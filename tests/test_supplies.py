"""Test suite for bundlelib's supplies-entry writer, and for supplies.py.

Run it with:  python3 tests/test_supplies.py

`supplies:` is what tells a runner which files a course hands the learner's
workspace, so no lesson ever assigns "copy these files" as a task. This
suite has two halves.

The unit half covers the three functions bundlelib gives every caller that
needs to write a supplies entry:

  emit_scalar             a single YAML scalar, quoted only when it has to be
  render_supplies_item    the lines for one supplies entry
  add_supplies            append an entry to a manifest or a frontmatter block

The central risk there is silent corruption: an emitter that writes bytes
which parse into something the author did not type. So every case in that
half is a ROUND TRIP - the emitted text is parsed back through this
project's own restricted loader, `yamlite.load_yaml`, and the parsed value
is compared against what went in. A test that only checked "it looks quoted"
would miss exactly the bug this file exists to catch.

The CLI half exercises `scripts/supplies.py list` and `scripts/supplies.py
add` end to end, against the runner's real validator (found the same way the
tool itself finds it). It mirrors tests/test_lesson_add.py's habits: every
refusal is shown firing, with a POSITIVE CONTROL beside it that differs only
in the thing under test, and every refusal is followed by a `tree_digest`
comparison rather than "the new file is absent".

"""`lesson.py add` - the operation that creates a lesson.

Stdlib only, no pytest: `python3 tests/test_lesson_add.py`.

Three habits run through this file, and each is a rule this project has
already paid for once:

  * every failure is shown FIRING, and every refusal has a POSITIVE CONTROL
    beside it - the same probe, on an input that differs only in the thing
    under test, reporting the opposite. A refusal that fires for the wrong
    reason looks identical to one that fires for the right reason;
  * no filename is asserted with `.exists()`. Where the filesystem folds
    case, `(folder / "LESSON.md").exists()` is True for a folder holding
    `lesson.md`; where it does not, the same call is False and still says
    nothing about the `lesson.md` beside it. Neither answer names what is on
    disk, so every filename assertion goes through `listing()` /
    `has_exactly()`, and the folder case also asserts
    `has_miscased(...) is None`. The control for that probe (case A2) is
    written against `folds_case()`, so it makes the same claim on a
    case-sensitive filesystem as on this one;
  * every refusal is followed by a `tree_digest` comparison, not by "the new
    file is absent". A half-written tutorial.yaml would pass the weaker
    check. The digest oracle itself is shown FIRING in case 5, where a real
    add changes it - otherwise "the digest matched" would be unfalsifiable.

"""audit.py - the evidence a course-quality review starts from.

Run: python3 tests/test_audit.py

`audit.py` lives in a different skill (`skills/course-quality/`) from every
other script this suite exercises, so it is run as a SUBPROCESS, exactly the
way every other suite here runs its script - never imported. `harness.py`
already inserts `skills/belay-authoring/scripts` onto `sys.path` for the
authoring scripts; a second insert for `skills/course-quality/scripts` would
put two script directories on one path, and any module name they share (this
script imports `bundlelib`, which is not its own) would then resolve by
insert order rather than by which directory actually owns it.

The toil scanner is a CANDIDATE GENERATOR, not a verdict, and this suite
tests that discipline directly with a real positive and a real negative
control, both drawn from the actual belay-bundles corpus:

  * POSITIVE - the copy-the-starter constraint from
    webgl-typescript-scene/lessons/00-project-setup/LESSON.md:34, reproduced
    in the `toil-course` fixture, must produce a candidate;
  * NEGATIVE - "Provide a direct-copy composition shader before adding
    effects.", from webgl-typescript-scene/lessons/15-render-to-texture.md:41
    and reproduced in the same fixture, contains the word "copy" and must
    NOT produce one. A scanner that fires on the bare word would pass the
    positive case and still be useless.

The coverage-list parser gets the same treatment: a fixture that HAS a list
proves it is read verbatim, a second fixture - the same bundle with the
section deleted - proves absence comes back as `None`, not `[]`, and a THIRD
case (a copy of the second with just the heading re-added, no topics under
it) proves a declared-but-empty list is neither of the other two. Without
each control, its neighbour is indistinguishable from a parser that cannot
tell the cases apart.

Fix round 1 narrowed `move` and `unzip`/`extract` to require a file-or-path
token on the same line, after both patterns turned out to have zero observed
true positives across the two real bundles while firing constantly on
ordinary technical prose. `copy` was deliberately left alone - it produced
both of this scanner's required true positives. The narrowing is tested with
both halves, using the real corpus sentences for the negative half wherever
one already existed.

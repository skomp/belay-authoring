"""Validator discovery - the false-oracle guard for the whole toolkit.

Run it:  python3 tests/test_validator_discovery.py

The toolkit makes exactly one safety promise: a mutating operation never
leaves a bundle broken and reports it as done. That promise IS the runner's
validator. So when the validator cannot be found there is only one honest
answer - refuse - and the thing this file exists to prove is that the refusal
really happens, on every mutating entry point, before any file is touched.

A run that silently skipped validation would be the worst possible outcome:
it would report a success it had never checked, which is precisely the shape
of failure this project has been bitten by before.

Every negative here therefore has a POSITIVE CONTROL: the identical command
in the normal environment, succeeding. "It failed with the runner hidden" is
not evidence unless the same command is shown passing with the runner there -
a typo in the argv, a bad fixture or an unrelated bug fails identically.

`harness.no_runner_env` is the hiding mechanism: HOME is redirected at an
empty directory, so search locations 2, 3 and 4 all resolve under it and
miss, and $BELAY_VALIDATOR is unset so location 1 does not answer either.
bundlelib uses os.path.expanduser, which reads HOME, so this exercises the
same code path a machine without the runner installed would.

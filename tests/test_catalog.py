"""catalog.py - the generated catalogue for a repository of bundles.

Run: python3 tests/test_catalog.py

catalog.py makes three claims that a reader cannot check by eye, and all three
are asserted here against values rather than shapes:

  * every `source.path` is RELATIVE, so the repository can serve its own
    bundles wherever it is checked out;
  * `scope` is DERIVED from the lesson count, not invented. Asserting the two
    fixtures' scope strings would not show that - a hardcoded lookup table
    would pass. So synthetic bundles are built at each of `catalog.SCOPE_BANDS`
    ceilings and one lesson past it, and the boundary is asserted from the
    module's own numbers rather than from numbers copied into this file;
  * the written catalogue passes the runner's own catalogue validator. The
    tool says so on stderr; this suite does not take its word for it and runs
    the validator again itself - and, because a validator probe that cannot
    fail proves nothing, runs the same probe against a catalogue known to be
    bad and confirms it reports the failure.

Note on streams: catalog.py writes its notes and its validator verdict to
STDERR and the catalogue itself to stdout only under `-o -`. `Run.output` is
used wherever both matter.

"""index.py - the compact bundle index.

Run: python3 tests/test_index.py

index.py exists so an interview about restructuring one chapter of a 23-lesson,
~2,700-line course does not begin by loading the course. Two properties carry
that promise, and both are easy to claim and hard to check:

  * the index is SHORT - the design says roughly 40 lines for 23 lessons, so
    this asserts the real line count rather than "it is not enormous";
  * the index reads FRONTMATTER ONLY, with the single documented exception of
    the first line of each `## Purpose` section.

The second is tested with a sentinel and a POSITIVE CONTROL. Asserting that a
unique string buried under `## Theory` is absent from the output proves nothing
on its own - a probe that looks for the wrong string, or an index that printed
nothing at all, would pass it too. So the same sentinel is also placed on the
first line of `## Purpose` in a second copy, where it MUST appear. Only the two
together say anything.

Every failure flag below is shown firing against a deliberately broken copy of
a fixture, and each one is paired with the unmodified fixture as its control.

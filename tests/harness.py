"""Shared machinery for the belay-authoring test suites.

No pytest. Nothing is installed in this environment, so every suite is a
plain `python3 tests/test_*.py` runner and this module is what they share.

Three things here are load-bearing, and each exists because of a mistake this
project has already made once.

`tree_digest` - the atomicity proof. Every mutating operation must leave the
bundle BYTE-IDENTICAL when it fails. A test that only checked "the lesson
file is still absent" would pass against a half-edited tutorial.yaml, so the
check hashes every path, every mode bit and every byte.

`listing` - the case-insensitivity trap. A macOS or Windows filesystem folds
case: `Path("lessons/lesson.md").exists()` is True in a directory holding
`LESSON.md`, so a fixture built with a rename that only changes case is a
silent no-op that tests nothing. A Linux filesystem does not fold case, and
answers False to the same question - which is no better, because it says
nothing about the mis-cased entry that is really there. Every assertion about
a filename goes through os.listdir, which reports the same truth on both.
`folds_case` says which kind of filesystem the suite is running on, for the
one case that has to assert something about exists() itself.

`no_runner_env` - the false-oracle guard. A test that shows a failure path
firing is worth nothing unless the same probe can be shown reporting the
opposite. Every negative case in this suite has a positive control beside it.

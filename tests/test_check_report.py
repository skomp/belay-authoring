"""check_report.py - re-adding a finished course-quality report against itself.

Run: python3 tests/test_check_report.py

COST
====

`COST = "cheap"`. This suite spends no tokens and touches no bundle. It reads
reports, which is all the script under test does.

WHAT THIS SUITE IS ACTUALLY ABOUT
=================================

Two failure modes, and the second is the one that costs something.

**A check that finds nothing when a defect is there.** The audit of
2026-09-13 published five reports; two carried arithmetic defects that
survived publication and were found only when a second reader added the
columns. Those two reports, as they stood before commit `19c92f5`, are pinned
in `tests/fixtures/reports/` and are the positive control for the whole
script. If those two cases ever stop firing, the script is worthless whatever
else passes: it would be reporting clean on the exact input it exists for.

**A check that reports clean because it could not read the input.** This is
`CLAUDE.md`'s `FAIL - 0 finding(s)` in a new costume - a checker that found no
tables, found therefore no mismatch, and called that a pass. The reports are
hand-written Markdown and their table shapes differ between authors, so a
parser that goes blind on one author's shape is not a hypothetical. Three
fixtures exist for it: a report whose breakdowns are prose and not tables, a
report with no course-total block, and a report with one score cell the
parser cannot read. Each must come back BLIND (exit 2), never clean.

Beside it sits the opposite control, because a blindness signal nobody has
watched NOT fire is not a signal: `excluded-row.md` carries a row the report
itself marks "not an element", and that row must be excluded and reported as
excluded, not counted as a blind spot.

THE LIVE CORPUS, AND WHY A PASS ON IT MEANS SOMETHING
=====================================================

The suite also runs the script over the ten reports in `docs/audits/`. They
are expected to be clean - that is the acceptance criterion of
`skomp/belay-authoring#12`, and it is also a standing regression guard: a
report edited into inconsistency turns this suite red.

A clean run over ten files proves nothing on its own, so every one of those
ten is then MUTATED - one element score changed, and separately the course
total changed - and the mutant must be rejected. That is what separates "the
tables add up" from "the parser never found the tables".

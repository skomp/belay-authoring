"""promote.py - the ten-step promotion procedure of bundle-format.md section 8.

Run it:  python3 tests/test_promote.py

Every refusal below is shown FIRING, and every refusal has a POSITIVE CONTROL
beside it: the same command against material that differs only in the one
thing the refusal is supposed to be about, succeeding. Without the control,
"it refused" is evidence of nothing - a refusal for an unrelated reason
(a typo'd path, a missing validator, a dirty tree) looks exactly the same
from the outside, and this project has already been bitten by a probe whose
negative result nobody had shown could ever turn positive.

Two invariants are asserted after EVERY promote in this file, success or
failure:

  * the learner's instance is BYTE-IDENTICAL afterwards. Step 9 is explicit
    that the learner's copy stays; a tool that moved rather than copied would
    take a file out of a live course and the learner would find out later.
  * on any failure the bundle is BYTE-IDENTICAL. "The new lesson is absent"
    is the weaker check, and a half-written tutorial.yaml passes it.

Both fixtures are copied per case. Neither is ever edited in place.

"""Test suite for `lesson.py renumber`.

Run it with:  python3 tests/test_lesson_renumber.py

Renumber is the operation the design calls out as able to silently corrupt a
23-lesson course, and section 9 of the design is normative about the one
thing the validator cannot catch:

    Lesson files reference other lessons BY ID, IN PROSE. Renumbering
    rewrites filenames, slugs, ids and the manifest, and leaves those prose
    references pointing at ids that no longer exist. The validator would NOT
    catch it: design_refs and validators are checked, a prerequisite named in
    prose is not.

So the central case here is not "renumber ran". It is that a real prose
`Prerequisites:` line in a copy of the REAL AutomatonDB bundle is rewritten,
with the exact new bytes asserted - and, just as importantly, that the four
things it must NOT touch are byte-identical afterwards:

  * a substring of an id it is renaming            02-typed-keys
  * a longer token containing an id                lessons/03-x.md.bak
  * an id it does not own                          a lesson not being moved
  * a token that looks like a reference and is not 99-does-not-exist

A rewriter that can only be shown rewriting is a false oracle: it would pass
identically if it rewrote everything it saw. Every negative here has the
positive beside it.

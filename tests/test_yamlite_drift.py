"""yamlite.py is a VENDORED VERBATIM COPY - prove it has not drifted.

Run it:  python3 tests/test_yamlite_drift.py

skills/belay-authoring/scripts/yamlite.py is a byte-for-byte copy of the
runner's skills/belay/scripts/yamlite.py, with a provenance banner of
comment lines prepended. It is copied rather than imported so index.py and
catalog.py, which mutate nothing, work without the runner installed.

A vendored copy that drifts is worse than no copy at all: two readers that
disagree about one document mean the authoring tool and the validator
certify different things, and nothing anywhere reports it. That is the whole
reason this file exists.

It checks the same claim twice, by two independent methods:

  * TEXT      - the vendored file ends with the runner's file, byte for byte,
                and everything above that is comment lines.
  * BEHAVIOUR - both readers parse the same documents to the same values, and
                REJECT the same documents with the same message. A drift that
                somehow survived a byte comparison would still have to survive
                this.

Both checks carry a positive control: a deliberately perturbed copy, run
through the SAME comparison, which must report drift. A comparison nobody has
seen fail is not a comparison.

If the runner cannot be found, this suite does NOT pass. A silently skipped
drift check is a false oracle - it reads as "no drift" forever.

"""Cross-cutting proof of the toolkit's central safety property.

Run it with:  python3 tests/test_atomicity.py

Design section 8, last line:

    A failed operation must leave the bundle unchanged rather than
    half-edited. This is a TESTED PROPERTY, not an intention.

This suite is that test. It takes every mutating operation - `lesson.py add`,
`lesson.py renumber`, `promote.py` - and makes each one fail in four
independent ways, asserting after each failure that the bundle is
BYTE-IDENTICAL: every path, every mode bit, every byte.

The four ways matter, because they fail at different points and a design
that only survived one of them would not be atomic:

  1. before any work      - the runner's validator cannot be found
  2. before any work      - the git working tree is dirty
  3. after the whole edit - the validator reports the result invalid
  4. part-way through     - the manifest cannot be edited surgically

Each has a POSITIVE CONTROL beside it: the same command, in the same place,
succeeding. Without that, "the bundle did not change" is equally consistent
with a tool that does nothing at all, and this whole file would be a false
oracle.

`tree_digest` is what makes the assertion real. "The new lesson file is
absent" is a much weaker claim: it passes against a tutorial.yaml that was
rewritten and a STATE.template.md that was retargeted.

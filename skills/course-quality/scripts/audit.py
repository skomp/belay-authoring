"""Emit the evidence a course-quality review starts from.

Usage:
    audit.py <bundle> [--json]

This is the `course-quality` skill's own script, not the authoring toolkit's.
It reads a bundle and reports facts a script can honestly produce: the lesson
skeleton, the coverage list `COURSE.md` declares, the `DESIGN.md` anchors,
declared `supplies:` entries, and candidate sites of authored toil. Default
output is a Markdown skeleton for a human (or the skill that wraps this
script) to fill in with judgement; `--json` is the same data as a JSON
object.

THE DISCIPLINE THAT MATTERS MOST HERE: this script never rules on anything.

  * `candidates` is a list of possible toil sites, found by a regex over
    imperative-looking sentences. It is a CANDIDATE GENERATOR, nothing more.
    An empty list is NOT evidence that a course has no toil - it is evidence
    only that this particular pattern found nothing, and the skill that
    consumes this output must read the lessons itself before concluding
    anything. A scanner nobody has watched fire is not a scanner, and a
    scanner nobody has watched stay silent on a near-miss is worse - see
    the negative control in tests/test_audit.py and in the corpus itself
    (webgl-typescript-scene/lessons/15-render-to-texture.md:41, "Provide a
    direct-copy composition shader before adding effects.", which contains
    the word "copy" and must never appear here).
  * `topic_candidates` is the same kind of guess, from word overlap between
    a coverage-list topic and a lesson's title, slug, design_refs and
    learning objectives. It never claims a topic is covered - an empty
    hit list for a topic says only that no lesson's frontmatter shares a
    meaningful word with it, which is itself worth a human's attention, not
    a verdict that the topic is untaught.
  * `symbol_evidence` TABULATES candidates from THREE rules - a short
    backticked token (`short-token`), a multi-word `## Concepts to teach`
    term the course also uses (`concept-phrase`), and a 2-to-5 letter
    all-capitals run (`acronym`) - and fills in the same evidence columns for
    each: does any lesson's `## Concepts to teach` name it, is there a
    defining sentence near the first use, is there one elsewhere in the same
    lesson or in another lesson, does its own `## Theory` section merely
    mention it, and does only `DESIGN.md` bind it. Every row names the
    channel that produced it. It does NOT decide whether a candidate is a
    parameter of the subject (`N`, `W`, `base offset`) or an identifier of
    the chosen language (`go`, `fn`, `traits`) - that distinction is
    categorical and a reader makes it, so there is no keyword denylist and no
    uppercase-only rule here. Its `status` separates "nothing to check" from
    "checked and clean", and its `warnings` name any evidence channel that
    was blind.
  * `unsupplied_setup` answers THREE conditions about the first lesson and
    reports a finding only when all three hold (belay-authoring#11, item
    3): the lesson contains a project-creation step, no `supplies` entry is
    in scope for it, and no hand-over to the tutor is declared - in the
    lesson text AND in `ownership_policy`, which is guard 2 of the rubric
    section "A step the tutor performs is not an element". The third
    condition is the whole design: a course that correctly hands its setup
    to the TUTOR also declares zero `supplies` entries, so the shape the
    issue originally described would have flagged the courses that do the
    right thing. It carries the same `status` and `warnings` pair as the
    two sections below, and a first lesson that could not be read reports
    `nothing-to-check`, never an empty finding list that reads as clean.
  * `coverage_list` reads the topics `COURSE.md` declares, from Markdown
    list items OR from a fenced block (one topic per non-empty line) - the
    corpus uses both, and reading only the first form made this script state
    that rust-automaton-db's author "never filled it in" over a fence
    holding 45 topics (belay-authoring#10). It carries the SAME `status`
    and `warnings` pair as `symbol_evidence`, for the same reason: an empty
    `topics` must never be mistaken for a course that declared none. THREE
    results are distinct - `null` (no heading at all), a `nothing-to-check`
    dict with `scan.body_lines == 0` (heading, nothing under it), and a
    `nothing-to-check` dict with `scan.body_lines > 0` (a coverage list this
    parser COULD NOT READ, which is a fact about this script and not about
    the course).

This script computes no score. Scoring is judgement (the rubric in
`references/rubric.md`, applied by the skill this script serves); this
script's job stops at honest evidence.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The toil scanner
#
# A candidate generator (see the module docstring). It requires the verb at
# an imperative "lead" position - the start of a line, of a markdown bullet,
# of a sentence, of an introductory clause set off by a comma or semicolon,
# or right after "must"/"should"/"then" - so that a noun phrase like
# "a direct-copy composition shader" does not fire just because it contains
# the word "copy", and so that "Do not copy X" (an instruction NOT to do
# something) does not fire either, since "copy" there follows "not ", not a
# lead.
#
# The comma alternative is load-bearing. Real toil in the corpus reads
# "Before starting, copy every file under `model/` ..." - an introductory
# clause, so the verb is neither at the start of the line nor after a full
# stop. Without it the scanner misses
# webgl-typescript-scene/lessons/13-load-gltf-model/LESSON.md:40, which is
# one of the two sites this script is required to find.
#
# The semicolon alternative (fix round 2) is load-bearing the same way.
# The regenerated webgl catalogue still carries the five-file copy
# instruction that started this whole change, now at
# lessons/01-canvas-and-context/LESSON.md:42: "... the tutor MUST read
# `starter/README.md`; copy `starter/package.json`, ...". Without
# `(?<=;\s)` the scanner produced ZERO candidates for the exact sentence
# whose presence in lesson 00 is why this tool exists - a scanner that
# misses it in a bundle where it is still present is not doing its job.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The unit of scanning: a PARAGRAPH, not a physical line (fix round 2).
#
# Prose in this corpus is hard-wrapped, so a physical line routinely begins
# mid-sentence. `_LEAD` starting with `^` cannot tell "a fresh sentence
# happens to start at column 0" from "a hard-wrap happens to land here",
# and durable-event-broker/lessons/14-asynchronous-follower.md:30 is a real
# false positive from exactly that confusion: the sentence is "... Therefore
# the\ncopy is neither a quorum ...", so the NOUN "copy" (its article "the"
# sits on the PREVIOUS physical line) lands at a physical line's start and
# reads, to a per-line scan, exactly like an imperative "Copy ...".
#
# The fix is to decide the MATCH against the joined paragraph, while still
# reporting the single physical line a reader would open their editor to -
# `_paragraph_blocks` groups physical line indices into the units scan_toil
# treats as one piece of prose, `_join_block` reassembles a block's lines
# into one string (word-unwrapped) plus a map back to physical lines, and
# `_line_for_offset` uses that map to attribute a match position to its
# real line.
#
# A blank line always ends a block. A heading or a markdown bullet always
# STARTS a fresh block of its own, even with no blank line before it - each
# bullet is a complete, self-contained unit, and joining two consecutive
# bullets into one string would let the FIRST bullet's marker satisfy
# `_LEAD` for a word in a LATER bullet that never had one.

    heading that says what it is ("Topics this course must cover", "Rust
    coverage requirements", ...). A course MAY have none - that is a finding
    in itself, so this returns None rather than [], and callers must not
    confuse the two: an empty list would be indistinguishable from a parser
    that cannot tell "absent" from "empty".

    The heading is matched on the substring "cover" (case-insensitive),
    which both real examples in bundle-format.md contain and which the
    other headings a COURSE.md carries ("Course map", "Checkpoints",
    "Explicit boundaries", "Prerequisites", ...) do not.

    TWO forms of list are read under that heading, because the corpus uses
    both: Markdown list items (durable-event-broker, portable-bytebeat-wav,
    portable-fixed-window-rate-limiter, webgl-typescript-scene) and a FENCED
    BLOCK, one topic per non-empty line (rust-automaton-db, `COURSE.md:225`,
    45 topics inside a ```text fence). Reading only the first form is
    belay-authoring#10: the script reported an empty list and the
    Markdown report said the author "never filled it in", which was false,
    and which would have suppressed five real coverage gaps had the auditor
    believed it.

    List items WIN when both are present, so the four bundles that use them
    are unaffected; the unread fence is then reported as a blind channel in
    `warnings`, never dropped in silence. See `_coverage_section` for the
    status vocabulary, which is `symbol_evidence`\'s.

    A heading matching "cover" with topics under it wins outright. If
    several such headings exist, the first one that actually lists topics is
    used; the search keeps going past a heading with nothing under it, in
    case a later heading is the real one. Only if NO matching heading ever
    has topics does this fall back to reporting the first topic-less one it
    saw, which is a THIRD, DISTINCT case from "no matching heading at all"
    (returns None). A course that writes the heading and lists nothing under
    it has done something different from a course that never declared a
    coverage list, and this function must not collapse the two.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The unsupplied setup step (belay-authoring#11, item 3)
#
# A learner reached the first lesson of a portable course, found that it
# assigned creating the project skeleton, and asked for the files instead
# (skomp/belay-bundles#3). Neither instrument saw it: the validator does
# not require a `supplies` entry, and the toil scanner above holds a fixed
# verb list that produced no candidate for two of the five catalogue
# bundles.
#
# The shape the issue first described - "0 supplies entries plus a
# create-the-project step in the first lesson" - DOES NOT DISCRIMINATE.
# Implementing it would have flagged the two courses that do the right
# thing, because a course that hands the setup to the TUTOR also declares
# zero `supplies` entries. The separator is already written down:
# `references/rubric.md`, section "A step the tutor performs is not an
# element". Its guard 2 requires the hand-over to be declared in the lesson
# text AND in the `ownership_policy` the bundle sets, and rules that a
# reviewer who cannot point at the declaration scores the step as assigned
# to the learner, because that is what an unmodified runner will do. This
# scanner is that reviewer, so THREE conditions must hold together:
#
#   1. the first lesson contains a project-creation step;
#   2. no `supplies` entry is in scope for that lesson;
#   3. no hand-over is declared - the lesson text does not say the tutor
#      creates it, or `ownership_policy` does not permit the tutor to.
#
# Conditions 1 and 3 are deliberately separate, and not folded into one
# "assigned to the learner" test. Condition 1 finds the STEP, whoever is to
# perform it; condition 3 asks whether the bundle declared that it changes
# hands. That is the rubric's own structure, and it is why the two
# tutor-handled courses in the catalogue produce a condition-1 hit and no
# finding, rather than no hit at all - a reader can see the guard doing
# work instead of taking a silent scanner on trust.
#
# `on-request` and `unrestricted` are the two policies that permit the
# tutor to build a skeleton it invents. `tutor-must-not-edit-learner-owned`
# does not: the create-only exemption in the runner's `bundle-format.md`,
# section "The ownership exemption", reaches DECLARED paths only, and a
# layout the tutor works out for a language the bundle never heard of
# declares none. (Cite that file by section name and never by line number -
# the released plugin copy and the repository source disagree.)
#
# Like every other section in this file, this is EVIDENCE and never a
# verdict, and it computes no score. It reports which of the three
# conditions it could answer, and names the rubric section a reader applies
# to the answers.

# Symbols a lesson uses and nothing introduces (belay-authoring#14).
#
# THE SAME DISCIPLINE AS EVERY OTHER SCANNER HERE, AND MORE STRICTLY: this
# TABULATES candidates, it does not classify them. The author ruled that the
# distinction between a conceptual parameter of the thing being taught (`N`,
# `W`) and an identifier of the chosen language (`bool`, `go`, `fn`) is
# CATEGORICAL and that no script can make it today - a reader makes it. So
# there is deliberately:
#
#   * no keyword denylist. `go`, `fn`, `id`, `ok` and `db` are emitted like
#     any other candidate, with the evidence a reader needs to dismiss them.
#   * no uppercase-only rule. The issue's own open question floats "report a
#     single uppercase letter only"; that rule silently drops `n`, `w`, `qs`
#     and anything a course writes in lower case, and this scanner's job is
#     to make sure a reader cannot MISS a candidate.
#   * no pruning of a candidate because some evidence channel bound it. EVERY
#     candidate is emitted with all four evidence columns filled in and a
#     `binding` field that is a PURE FUNCTION of those columns. A reader who
#     disagrees with a "definition" this scanner found can see the sentence
#     it matched, quoted, and overrule it.
#
# THE CANDIDATE RULE, and why it is this one.
#
# A candidate is an IDENTIFIER TOKEN OF ONE OR TWO CHARACTERS that appears
# inside an EXPRESSION-SHAPED backticked span.
#
#   * "one or two characters" is the issue's own bound. Two is the first
#     bound that keeps `qs`, `dt`, `id` and `go` while dropping `New`, `bool`
#     and `null` by length alone rather than by a denylist - which is exactly
#     the line the author drew. It is a property of the TOKEN, never of the
#     whole span.
#   * "expression-shaped" is what keeps `N + 1` from being lost. The issue
#     names `N + 1` as a symbol that must survive, and a rule that measured
#     the whole backticked span would throw it away at five characters. So
#     the span is TOKENIZED, and a span qualifies when it holds nothing but
#     identifiers, integer literals, whitespace and arithmetic/comparison
#     operators. `N + 1` yields the candidate `N`; `starter/package.json`
#     and `db.Exec()` are excluded outright by the `.` they contain, before
#     length is even considered.
#
# A pure digit run (`1`, `256`) is a literal, not an identifier, and is never
# a candidate.

# belay-authoring#18 - two more candidate channels, for the same row.
#
# The audit of 2026-09-15 answered the undefined-symbol row by hand across
# five bundles and found six symbols. The short-token channel above found
# NONE of them, and the reason is structural rather than a bug: every one of
# the six is a WORD or an ACRONYM, and three of them are not in backticks at
# all. A 1-2 character token rule cannot reach any of them.
#
# The fix the issue forbids is widening the token rule. A rule reporting
# every 3-to-5 character backticked token reports `bool`, `New`, `go`, `Vec`,
# `impl` and every type name in every Rust lesson, and the author has ruled
# that the sort between a parameter of the subject and an identifier of the
# chosen language is CATEGORICAL - no rule of shape performs it. So instead
# of one wider rule there are two more NARROW ones, each with its own source:
#
#   * `concept-phrase` - the course's own `## Concepts to teach` list is the
#     candidate source. A course states its vocabulary there, so nothing is
#     guessed. The direction is inverted from the short-token channel: that
#     one finds uses and asks whether they are defined; this one takes a
#     declared concept and asks whether any lesson ever defines it.
#   * `acronym` - an all-capitals run of 2 to 5 letters. `CAS`, `WAL` and
#     `FST` share exactly one shape. `AST`, `GC` and `NFA` share it too and
#     the human reader PASSED them, which is the expected outcome: these are
#     candidates, and a reader sorts them.
#
# Neither channel classifies, neither computes a score, and both fill in the
# same evidence columns as the short-token channel.
#
# WHY A CONCEPT PHRASE MUST ALSO BE MENTIONED SOMEWHERE ELSE. Reading every
# Concepts bullet as a candidate produces 111, 176 and 172 rows against
# durable-event-broker, rust-automaton-db and webgl-typescript-scene, and a
# report nobody reads is worth less than a smaller one somebody does. The
# candidate rule therefore requires the declared term to appear OUTSIDE every
# `## Concepts to teach` section - that is the moment a learner meets the
# word and needs it to have been introduced. Measured on the same three
# bundles the rule yields 13, 52 and 62 terms.
#
# THE TWO-WORD PARTIAL MENTION. `webgl-typescript-scene` declares the concept
# `thickness bias` and then writes, in prose, "Expose step count, thickness
# and maximum distance as controlled parameters."
# (17-depth-reconstruction-and-ssr.md:45). The compound never appears again;
# the bare word does, and the bare word is what the human reader reported. So
# a TWO-word term whose full phrase is never mentioned falls back to its
# constituent words, under three restrictions that keep the fallback from
# becoming a word-soup scanner: the word is at least 5 characters, it appears
# in no OTHER declared concept of the same bundle (a word shared by several
# concepts - "error", "context", "index" - is a generic modifier, not a
# term), and it is mentioned in the lesson that DECLARED the concept. Terms
# of three words and more do not fall back at all; that is a stated blind
# spot, not an oversight.
#
# ONE-WORD CONCEPTS ARE A STATED BLIND SPOT. `metrics`, `traits`, `mmap`,
# `arc`, `indices` and `precision` are one-word Concepts bullets, and the
# sort between "vocabulary of the subject" and "name in the chosen language"
# is exactly the categorical sort the author ruled a script cannot make.
# Emitting them would put 26 Rust API names into rust-automaton-db's report.
# They are not reported, and this comment is the record of that choice.

# Assembly of the symbol evidence
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The buckets, strongest evidence first. `binding` is a PURE FUNCTION of the
# evidence columns and ranks them in this order; it is a label for a row of
# facts, not a judgement about the symbol.
#
# `other-lesson-prose` exists so that `design-md-only` means what the issue
# needs it to mean. `portable-bytebeat-wav` uses `t` in four lessons; only
# `DESIGN.md:24` and lesson 00's own objectives bind it. Without a column for
# a definition in a DIFFERENT lesson, lessons 01, 02 and `stereo-bytebeat`
# would all land in `design-md-only` while lesson 00 in fact defines `t` in
# prose - and "only DESIGN.md binds this" would be a false statement. The
# bucket is still a finding worth a reader's eye (a learner who starts at
# lesson 01 has met no definition), which is why it sits below the
# same-lesson buckets rather than beside `concepts`.
#
# `concepts` MOVED DOWN in belay-authoring#18, from the top of this list
# to just below every prose bucket. It used to outrank a real defining
# sentence, which meant that for `N` in portable-fixed-window-rate-limiter
# the report showed the weakest evidence and hid the strongest. The issue
# states the principle plainly: a symbol named in `## Concepts to teach` is
# NOT thereby introduced, and the row passes on a defining sentence. The
# bucket is kept rather than deleted, because deleting it would drop `E`,
# `Eq` and `T` - Rust type parameters named in a Concepts bullet and nowhere
# else - into `none` and invent four findings.
#
# `theory-mention` is new and applies ONLY to a `concept-phrase` candidate.
# A concept the course declares it will teach and then discusses in its own
# `## Theory` section has been addressed by the bundle's explaining section,
# which is weaker than a definition and much stronger than silence; against
# the five real bundles it takes 46 rows out of `none`. It does NOT apply to
# a short token or an acronym: `WAL` appears in a Theory paragraph of
# rust-automaton-db/lessons/10-storage-durability.md and is still introduced
# nowhere, and burying it under a "mentioned in Theory" heading would hide
# exactly the finding this change exists to surface.

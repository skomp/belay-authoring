# The modify interview

**Status:** normative. Load this when a bundle exists and something about it is to change,
and before promoting a generated lesson.

Modifying is not a smaller version of creating. It has a different first move, a different
first question, and one job that create does not have at all: **surfacing knock-on
effects**. Renaming a `DESIGN.md` anchor is one edit and four broken lessons. The author
cannot see the four. The index can.

---

## 1. Start from the index, never from the course

Before the first question:

```
python3 scripts/index.py <bundle>
```

The index is generated mechanically from the manifest and lesson frontmatter — id, title,
form, `design_refs`, `validators`, and a one-line purpose per lesson. A twenty-three-lesson
course is roughly 2,700 lines; its index is roughly 40. Loading the course to discuss
restructuring one chapter spends the entire context budget before the conversation starts.

**What the index answers on its own:**

| Question | How |
|---|---|
| which lessons cite a given `DESIGN.md` anchor | their `design_refs` |
| which lessons use a given validator | their `validators` |
| what order the lessons are in, and what is first | the list order |
| whether a lesson is a single file or a folder | its form |
| roughly what each lesson is for | its purpose line |

**What it does not answer**, and what you therefore open specific lessons for:

- prose prerequisites — a lesson naming an earlier lesson's id in its *Prerequisites*
  section. The index does not carry lesson bodies and the validator does not check these.
- completion conditions, constraints, and anything else in a lesson body.
- whether the material in a lesson folder is still referenced by its `LESSON.md`.

Open only the lessons the interview shows you will touch, plus the ones the knock-on
tables below name. If you find yourself opening a fifth lesson to answer one question,
stop and ask the author instead.

## 2. Ask what is wrong, not what the author wants

Authors arrive with a fix, not a complaint: *"split lesson 07"*, *"rename the
`key-ordering` anchor"*. The fix is a hypothesis about a problem you have not heard yet,
and it is frequently the wrong repair for the right complaint. So the first question is
some form of:

> "What goes wrong for a learner at that point?"

*"Split lesson 07"* often turns out to be *"learners get lost in 07"*, and the repair is
as often a missing prerequisite in 06, or completion conditions nobody can check, as it is
a split. *"Rename the anchor"* is sometimes *"the design decision changed"*, which is a
`DESIGN.md` rewrite plus every lesson that depended on the old decision — a much larger
change than a rename.

Two follow-ups earn their place:

- **Is there evidence?** Generated lessons in real instances are the best signal the format
  produces. Several learners taking the same detour after the same lesson is a missing
  lesson, with the files as proof. One learner once is evidence of nothing.
- **Which learners is this for?** A change that helps the learner the course was written
  for is different from one that quietly widens its audience — which is a scale change,
  not a fix.

### One symptom with a known repair: "the tutor made me copy files"

Authors and learners report this as a tone problem, a lesson-01 problem, or a tutor
problem. It is none of those. It means a lesson assigns toil: prose telling the learner to
copy, unzip or paste into place something the bundle could have shipped and did not. Ask
that question before reaching for the repair — **could this bundle have shipped the
result?** A step it could not ship, such as installing a toolchain, is the learner's work
and nothing here applies to it. When the answer is yes, the repair is mechanical and the
same every time.

1. Open the lesson the learner names and find the prose. It is usually in *Constraints* or
   *Suggested progression*, and it usually names a `starter/` directory.
2. Put the files inside the bundle if they are not there already. A manifest-scope file
   may sit anywhere in the bundle, and `supplies/` at the bundle root is the convention. A
   file that arrives with one lesson **MUST** be inside `lessons/`, because materialization
   copies only `lessons/` into the instance and the lesson is opened from there. Anywhere
   under `lessons/` satisfies that, a loose file directly under `lessons/` included, so a
   single-file lesson does not have to become a folder to supply one. The lesson's own
   folder is the convention, and it keeps the material beside its `LESSON.md`. Then
   declare them:
   `python3 scripts/supplies.py add <bundle> --from <path> --to <path> --describe <text>`,
   with `--lesson <lesson-id>` when they should arrive with that lesson rather than at the
   start. Show the `--check` run first.
3. Remove the prose from the lesson. The step is gone, not softened: the runner places the
   files and reports them as setup, so a lesson that still describes the copying is now
   describing work nobody does.
4. Ask what the lesson is left teaching. A lesson whose only content was the handover is
   not a shorter lesson now; it is not a lesson, and retiring it is the repair.

**Two repairs that look right and are not.** Rewriting the instruction more kindly leaves
the learner doing the same uninstructive work. Relaxing `ownership_policy` to
`unrestricted` so the tutor may place the files itself is worse: a regenerated course did
exactly that across all eighteen of its lessons, trading the guarantee that the tutor will
never write the learner's code for one bootstrap. `supplies:` exists so that trade is never
needed — it lets the tutor **create** a declared target that does not exist, and nothing
else.

## 3. Classify the change, and say so out loud

Same ratchet as the create interview, one-way, heavier when in doubt.

| Class | What it is | Process |
|---|---|---|
| **Cosmetic** | a typo, a clearer sentence, a better example inside one lesson. No structure moves. | State what you will change, change it, show the diff. No spec round. |
| **Local** | one lesson added, split, retired or reordered; a validator added; a `DESIGN.md` section extended. The arc is unchanged. | State the change **and its knock-on effects**, get a yes, apply with the toolkit, validate. Record the change in the course spec afterwards. |
| **Structural** | the arc changes: milestones move, chapters are resequenced, the end state or the audience changes, a design decision is reversed. | Run the relevant phases of the create interview, revise `specs/<bundle-id>.md`, and **stop for approval before touching a bundle file.** The gate is the same gate. |

A change that turns out to be structural mid-way upgrades. Say so and go back to the spec;
do not finish it as a local change because you have started.

**Every lesson you add, split or rewrite gets the toil test before it gets written:** *what
can the learner get wrong here, and does getting it wrong teach anything? If nothing, it is
not a task — it is `supplies:`.* A modify is where toil enters a course that did not have
any, because a change arrives as a fix for one learner's confusion and the quickest fix is
to hand the learner a step to perform. State the instructive failure of every lesson you
touch, in the spec, in one line. A lesson you cannot write that line for is toil when the
bundle could have shipped what it asks for, and then the handover goes through
`supplies.py add`; when the bundle could not ship it, the step is the learner's own setup
and stays where it is.

## 4. The knock-on tables

This is the part the author cannot do without you. For the change in front of you, the
index answers the middle column; the right column is what you must raise **before**
applying anything.

### Structure

| Change | Ask the index | Raise with the author |
|---|---|---|
| **Add a lesson** | what is at that position now; which validators exist; which anchors exist | Does any later lesson's prerequisites now sit after it? Does it need a new anchor, or does it cite one that exists? Does the new topic belong in the coverage list? Does it hand the learner any file — if so, that is a `supplies:` entry, never its first task. |
| **Reorder or move a lesson** | the current order; the `design_refs` of everything between old and new position | Does the moved lesson's completion now depend on something that comes after it? Do the lessons it passes still have their prerequisites met? |
| **Split a lesson** | its `design_refs` and `validators` | Which half keeps which anchors, and which keeps the prose prerequisites other lessons name? A split changes one id into two, so every lesson naming the old id in prose needs a decision. |
| **Retire a lesson** | which anchors and validators only it used; where it sits | Which later lessons name it as a prerequisite in prose? Which anchors are now cited by nothing — remove them, or leave them as context? Does the coverage list still hold? Did it declare `supplies:` that later lessons need — those entries move to the manifest scope or to the lesson that needs them, or the files stop arriving. |
| **Renumber** | nothing; `renumber --check` reports it all | Show the `--check` output. It names every prose reference it would rewrite **and everything that looked like a reference and will be left alone** — that second list is where a break will be. |

### Design and validators

| Change | Ask the index | Raise with the author |
|---|---|---|
| **Rename a `DESIGN.md` anchor** | **every lesson whose `design_refs` cite it** | Anchors are stable once published, and the format has no aliasing: every citing lesson changes in the same commit or the bundle is broken. Name the lessons — "05, 07, 09 and 11" — and let the author decide whether the rename is worth it. |
| **Change what a decision says** | the same list | This is usually structural, not local. Every lesson taught against the old decision may now teach something wrong, and the validator cannot see that. |
| **Add or remove a decision** | which lessons might need it | A section nothing cites is harmless; a lesson citing a section that does not exist is invalid. |
| **Rename or remove a validator** | every lesson naming it | A lesson referencing an undeclared validator is invalid. All of them change together. |

### The pattern

The three questions behind every row: **who cites this, what breaks if it moves, and what
does the validator not check?** That last one is where the damage lives. `design_refs` and
validator names are checked; prose prerequisites, completion-condition ordering and
coverage-list accuracy are not. Those are yours.

## 5. Apply the change with the toolkit

Never by hand. The rules from the control plane, restated because this is where they are
broken:

1. **Run with `--check` first** and show the author the output. For `renumber` this is not
   optional courtesy; it is the only review the change gets.
2. **Let a refusal stand.** A dirty working tree is refused so that `git diff` is a true
   record of the tool's work. Commit or stash the author's own changes — do not `--force`
   past them, and never discard them.
3. **The validator runs after every mutating operation.** A run that leaves the bundle
   invalid fails loudly, and a failed run leaves the bundle unchanged rather than
   half-edited. If you are looking at a half-edited bundle, that is a defect in the
   toolkit and worth reporting, not working around.
4. **Check every rewrite the tool reports**, particularly `renumber`'s left-alone list.

Common sequences:

- **Adding a lesson**:
  `python3 scripts/lesson.py add <bundle> --id <slug> --title <text> --after <lesson-path>`,
  then `python3 scripts/lesson.py renumber <bundle> --check` if the numbering is now
  uneven, then fill the body, then validate.
- **Splitting a lesson**: add the second lesson with `lesson.py add`, move the prose
  yourself, then fix the prose prerequisites in the lessons the index named.
- **Retiring a lesson**: remove it from the course, then
  `python3 scripts/lesson.py renumber <bundle> --check`, then repair the prose references
  the report leaves alone.

## 6. Promoting a generated lesson

A tutor writes lessons into a learner's `tutorial/lessons.generated/` during a course.
Promotion is a bundle-side authoring act with a script:

```
python3 scripts/promote.py <instance> <generated-lesson-path> <bundle> --check
```

What to hold in mind while working through what it reports:

- **The learner keeps their copy.** Promotion copies; it never moves or deletes. That
  learner keeps working from their own file, and the duplicate is reported and resolved
  the next time they materialize a revision.
- **The provenance frontmatter goes.** `generated`, `generated_at`, `kind`, `reason` and
  `after` all describe one learner's run. All five, every time.
- **`id` becomes the new slug.** Generated lessons carry no number prefix, so the rename
  always changes the slug, and this is the easiest step to forget.
- **`design_refs` are re-checked against the bundle's `DESIGN.md`, not the instance's.**
  The instance's `DESIGN.md` grew during the course. A promoted lesson may cite an anchor
  the tutor appended and your bundle has never had. For each: add the section, or drop the
  reference.
- **The lesson is rewritten for a learner who has not started.** It was written against one
  learner's code and it names their types, their file, their error message. Generalise all
  of it. Nothing about their progress survives.
- **`COURSE.md` may owe an update** if the course now covers a chapter its map did not
  mention.

Ask first whether it should be promoted at all. One side lesson, once, is usually one
learner's background rather than a hole in the course. The same `after:` from several
learners is the signal worth acting on, and the repair may be to fix the lesson before the
detour rather than to add one after it.

---

## 7. Close the change out

- **Update the course spec.** `specs/<bundle-id>.md` is the reviewable record of the
  course's design. A local change adds a line to it; a structural change revised it before
  any file moved. A spec that no longer describes the bundle is worse than no spec, because
  the next author believes it. A change that added, moved or removed a supplied file
  updates the spec's *Supplied files* section in the same sitting; `python3
  scripts/supplies.py list <bundle>` prints what the bundle now declares.
- **Update `COURSE.md`** when the chapter map or coverage list moved.
- **Validate**, and work the runner's `bundle-format.md` section 10 self-check by looking.
- **Rebuild the catalogue** with `python3 scripts/catalog.py <bundles-repo>` if a bundle
  was added or renamed, or if the lesson count crossed the boundary the catalogue derives
  scope from.
- **Say what a learner mid-course gets**, because the answer is nothing: revising a bundle
  while an instance is live has no reconciliation story. The change reaches the learners who
  come after. Authors regularly assume otherwise.

"""Add a lesson to a bundle, or renumber the ones it already has.

Usage:
    lesson.py add <bundle> --id <slug> --title <text>
                           [--after <lesson-path> | --position <n>] [--folder]
                           [--check] [--force]
    lesson.py add <bundle> --id <slug> --title <text> --optional
                           --offer-at <lesson> --offer-because <text>
                           [--anticipates <failure-mode-id>]
                           [--repair-in <lesson>] [--required-for <lesson>]
                           [--folder] [--check] [--force]
    lesson.py renumber <bundle> [--check] [--force]

`--optional` creates a lesson the tutor OFFERS instead of sequencing. Such a
lesson is listed under `optional_lessons` and never under `lessons`, so it
has no position in the main path and therefore no number prefix and no
renumber. The three writes it makes - the lesson file, its `optional: true`
frontmatter and the `optional_lessons` entry - land together or not at all;
check 20 of the runner's validator requires the frontmatter and the list to
agree, so a half-applied run would leave a bundle the runner rejects.

Both subcommands MUTATE the bundle, so both obey the design's three safety
properties:

  * the runner's validator runs against the edited bundle, and a run that is
    not clean is discarded - the bundle is never left broken and reported as
    done;
  * --check does the whole operation on a staging copy, validates it, prints
    what it would do, and throws the copy away;
  * a dirty git working tree under the bundle refuses the run unless --force,
    so `git diff` afterwards is a record of exactly what this tool did.

A failure at any point leaves the bundle byte-identical. The edit happens on
a copy and is swapped in only after the validator passes.

Exit codes:
    0  done (or, with --check, the plan is printable and would validate)
    1  nothing to do
    2  usage, I/O, a refused run, or a validator failure

TODO: why this lesson exists and what pressure motivates it. The first line of
this section is what index.py shows, so make it one sentence.

## Prerequisites

TODO: what must already be true. Reference earlier lesson ids.

## Learning objectives

- TODO

## Theory

TODO: the concepts the learner needs. Teach them; do not assume them.

## Concepts to teach

TODO: named concepts the tutor must actually cover, not skip past.

## Constraints

TODO: what the learner's solution must and must not do.

## Suggested progression

TODO: a rough sequence of tasks. Not a script of conversational turns.

## Completion conditions

TODO: checkable conditions. Be specific enough that "looks plausible" is not
enough.

## On completion, persist

TODO: what to record in the instance's DESIGN.md or STATE.md.

## Optional deeper paths

TODO: material available if the learner asks. Not required.

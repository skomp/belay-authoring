"""Build a catalog.yaml for a repository of bundles.

Usage:
    catalog.py <bundles-repo> [-o <path>]

Scans `<bundles-repo>` for bundles, reads each manifest, and writes a
catalogue naming them by RELATIVE path, so the repository can ship its own
catalogue and every bundle travels with it. The default output is
`<bundles-repo>/catalog.yaml`, and `-o -` writes to stdout instead.

`scope` is the one field a catalogue carries that a bundle's tutorial.yaml
does not. It is DERIVED from the length of the manifest's lessons list rather
than invented, and the derivation is printed, because a scope that
under-states the work is a disservice to the learner choosing on it.

The written file is checked with the runner's own catalogue validator
(`validate_bundle.py --catalog --portable`) before this exits. A catalogue
this tool wrote and did not check would be exactly the drift it exists to
prevent.

Exit codes:
    0  written (or printed) and the validator passed
    1  no bundle was found under the given directory
    2  usage, I/O error, or the written catalogue did not validate

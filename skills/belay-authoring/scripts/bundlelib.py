"""Shared machinery for the belay-authoring toolkit.

Stdlib only. Python 3.11.

Three things live here that every script needs, and one that only the
mutating scripts need.

Shared by everything:
  * lesson discovery, the restricted YAML reader, exact-case path resolution
    and frontmatter splitting - all taken from the runner's
    validate_bundle.py rather than reinvented (see the provenance notes on
    each function);
  * surgical edits to tutorial.yaml, which rewrite the bytes the edit
    touches and leave comments, ordering and quoting alone. Round-tripping a
    manifest through a YAML emitter would reformat a file the author wrote
    by hand;
  * the lesson-id token rewriter, which is the one piece with no upstream
    equivalent, because the validator never rewrites anything.

Needed only by the mutating scripts (lesson.py, promote.py):
  * Staged, the transaction that gives every mutating operation the property
    the design demands: the bundle is either better or byte-identical,
    never half-edited. The mutation happens on a copy, the runner's
    validator runs against the copy, and only a clean validator run swaps
    the copy into place.

        learner rather than sequenced.

        CORRECTION, 2026-09-12. This docstring used to say the toolkit "does
        not author, edit or renumber such a lesson". Two thirds of that is
        no longer true and the last third never was:

          * `lesson.py add --optional` and `promote.py --optional` now
            author one, writing the entry through add_optional_lesson below;
          * `renumber` has always been correct here and needed no change. It
            iterates the manifest's `lessons` list, which an optional lesson
            is not in, so it never renames one - while its prose rewrite
            walks every readable file, so a reference INSIDE an optional
            lesson does follow a rename. tests/test_lesson_renumber.py locks
            both halves in.

        What this property buys the READING scripts is that the toolkit does
        not CRY WOLF about an optional lesson. Without it, index.py reports
        every one as UNLISTED and exits 1 on a bundle the runner considers
        valid, which is the "validator that gets ignored" failure the
        runner's own check 5 comments warn about.

        tell a finding from a warning, so it reads this instead. It takes the
        lines under the `FAIL - N finding(s):` header and stops at the first
        line that is not indented. A continuation line (indented, not
        `[check N]`) joins the entry before it, so a finding whose message
        carries a newline is one entry, not two.

        `complete` is False when the entries parsed do not number the N the
        header declared, or the header is missing. The caller must then treat
        the run as unreadable: a count it cannot reproduce must not be
        compared.

# by the same surgical append rather than by re-emitting the document from a
# parse tree - exactly the reasoning behind replace_lessons_list above.
#
# emit_scalar does NOT guess which characters are safe to leave unquoted. An
# earlier version of this design proposed a character-class regex
# (`[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9 ._/-]*`), reasoning that anything outside it needed
# quoting. Measured against this project's own loader, that regex was wrong
# in a way none of its own examples would have caught: "123", "true",
# "TRUE", "null", "Null", "0" and "3.14" all satisfy it, and all of them
# round-trip through yamlite as an int, a bool or None instead of the string
# they started as - the quiet corruption this function exists to prevent.
# So emit_scalar asks the loader directly: it renders the value unquoted,
# parses that rendering back through THIS PROJECT'S OWN `load_yaml`, and
# keeps the unquoted form only if the parsed value is the identical string.
# Anything else - a mismatch or a parse error - is quoted instead. This
# tracks whichever backend `load_yaml` is actually using (the restricted
# reader here, PyYAML if it is ever installed) rather than encoding one
# YAML dialect's rules by hand.
#
# THAT ORACLE IS BLIND IN ONE DIRECTION, and a review caught it. `load_yaml`
# is yamlite, this project's own LENIENT reader, so it is the one parser that
# cannot fail the check. It reads `value: a: b` back as the scalar 'a: b' and
# `value: - x` back as '- x', so the round-trip agreed and the unquoted form
# was kept - while js-yaml@4 REJECTS both with "bad indentation of a mapping
# entry". Both a manifest and a lesson frontmatter written by `supplies.py
# add` were rejected by js-yaml while the pinned validator accepted them, and
# the contract's own example (`describe: "Duck.glb: the sample model ..."`)
# is written QUOTED, a form this emitter could not produce.
#
# So the loader probe is kept - it is what catches '123', 'true' and 'null' -
# and a STRUCTURAL guard is applied before it. A plain scalar is portable
# only when it carries no block-structure indicator that a conforming parser
# reads as syntax. Measured against js-yaml@4, these are the shapes yamlite
# keeps and js-yaml refuses:
#
#   'a: b', 'x: y: z', 'a:  b', ': lead'   contain ': '
#   'x:', ':'                              end in ':'
#   '- x', '-'                             open a block sequence
#   '? x', '?'                             open a complex mapping key
#   ', a', '{x', '[1'                      OPEN with a flow indicator
#   'a\tb'                                 carry a tab
#
# Those four clauses were not guessed. Every one- two- and three-character
# string over a 27-character alphabet of letters, digits, spaces and YAML
# punctuation - 20454 values - was emitted by this function and read back by
# js-yaml@4, at the top level and nested inside a `supplies:` item. With the
# guard as written, all 20454 round-trip. Without its flow-indicator clause,
# 1944 fail, and every one of them opens with ',', '{', '[', '}' or ']'; a
# flow indicator INSIDE the value ('the model, which is a duck') is ordinary
# text and stays unquoted.
#
# THE MEASUREMENT IS BOUNDED, SO THE CLAIM IS. 20454 values is every string of
# at most THREE characters over ONE 27-character alphabet - it is not every
# value, and 'all 20454 round-trip' must not be read as 'everything does'.
# Longer values, and characters outside that alphabet, were never emitted.
# That bounded measurement predates belay-authoring#26, which found the
# survivors it missed: values a YAML 1.1 resolver retypes (`0x1f`, `.inf`,
# `Yes`, `1:30`, `2026-09-12`), ' #' inside a plain value, and an opening
# indicator character. The gate below now refuses all of them, so they are
# quoted. One residual limit remains, and emit_scalar refuses it instead of
# writing it: yamlite cannot read back a value holding an odd number of double
# quotes before ' #' (reader defect, belay#57).
#
# Quoting is always safe, so the guard errs towards quoting: it never has to
# decide that an unusual value is FINE, only that a value is plainly plain.

# The lesson-id token rewriter
#
# Spec section 9 is normative and the whole of this section implements it:
#
#   rewrite only exact whole-token matches of ids it is itself renaming,
#   never a substring, never an id it does not own; report every rewrite;
#   report anything that looks like a reference but does not match an id
#   being renamed, and leave it alone.
#
# The delimiter classes come from validate_bundle.names_file, which solves
# the same problem for material filenames: a plain substring search matches
# `02-typed-keys` inside `02-typed-keys-table-hierarchy`, and matches
# `03-first-refactor` inside `lessons/03-first-refactor.md.bak`.
#
# Two token kinds are rewritten, and reported separately:
#
#   id    a bare lesson id in prose - `Prerequisites: 02-typed-keys-...`
#   path  a full lesson path - `lessons/02-typed-keys-....md`, which is what
#         tutorial.yaml, STATE.template.md's active_lesson and any prose that
#         names a file use.
#
# The path kind is an extension beyond the letter of section 9, which speaks
# only of ids. It is included because a rename breaks a prose path exactly as
# it breaks a prose id, the rewriter owns both sides of the mapping, and
# leaving paths alone would mean reporting the manifest's own entries as
# dangling references. It is reported under its own label so the two are
# never confused in the output.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Not preceded by a path or word character, and not continuing into one.
#
# The trailing `(?!\.[A-Za-z0-9])` is the half that is easy to leave out and
# expensive to leave out: without it, `lessons/03-first-refactor.md` matches
# inside `lessons/03-first-refactor.md.bak`, and a renumber silently renames
# a reference to a file it is not moving. validate_bundle.names_file carries

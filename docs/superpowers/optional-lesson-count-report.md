# optional_lesson_count - implementation report

Issue: skomp/belay-authoring#8
Commit: `f9e5d5475b0a772bdf6665437f00c061f18f0090`

## Status

Done. Committed to `main` on top of a clean tree (no other change was in
flight). `../belay-bundles` was read-only for the whole task - no file
under it changed.

## What changed

`skills/belay-authoring/scripts/catalog.py`:

- Every catalogue entry now carries `optional_lesson_count`, computed as
  `len(bundle.optional)` where `bundle` is a `bundlelib.Bundle` built from
  the same manifest `catalog.py` already loads. `Bundle.optional` is the
  toolkit's one reader of a manifest's `optional_lessons:` mapping, so this
  reuses that read rather than adding a second, possibly-diverging one.
- The field is written on every entry, `optional_lesson_count: 0` included.
  Per the ruling on the issue: if 0 were omitted, an absent field would mean
  either "no optional lessons" or "generated before this field existed", and
  a reader could not tell which. Always writing it collapses that to one
  meaning - the catalogue predates the generator.
- The field name is deliberately `optional_lesson_count`, not
  `optional_lessons` (which already names a different-shaped field, a map of
  lesson path to offer metadata, in `tutorial.yaml`).
- The per-bundle stderr note gained the optional count alongside the
  existing lesson-count/scope note (`"N lessons -> scope '...', M optional
  lesson(s), path '...'"`).
- The file header comment gained one paragraph documenting the new
  derivation, matching the existing paragraph for `scope`.

`tests/test_catalog.py` gained one case, `case_optional_lesson_count`,
registered in `main()`:

- Three bundles in one repo: a real fixture with zero optional lessons
  (`foldered-bundle`), a real fixture with one (`optional-course`, already
  in the fixtures directory), and a synthetic bundle edited in the test to
  declare three optional lessons (`many-optional`).
- Asserts the exact values (`0`, `1`, `3`) via the harness's `entries()`
  parser, and additionally asserts the literal substrings
  `optional_lesson_count: 0` and `optional_lesson_count: 3` appear in the
  written catalogue text - the exact key name, not just a value that happens
  to match, because the runner's catalogue validator accepts any unknown
  entry field (recorded on the issue) and would validate a misspelling
  clean.
- Asserts the near-miss misspellings `optional_lessons_count` and
  `optional_lesson_counts` never appear, and that the entry never carries a
  bare `optional_lessons:` mapping (the other file's key, wrong shape,
  inside a catalogue entry).
- Asserts the generated catalogue still validates (`PASS`, no `FAIL -`) via
  the same subprocess run every other case in this suite already checks.
- No new fixture files were added; the "several" case is built with the
  existing `make_bundle()` + `edit()` helpers already used elsewhere in this
  suite, so no filesystem fixture had to be invented for the one new shape.

No fixtures were added under `tests/fixtures/`.

## Suite count

`python3 tests/test_catalog.py`: **100 assertions passed** (87 before this
change, 13 added; 0 removed, 0 skipped).

`python3 tests/run_all.py`: all 11 suites pass.

## Negative control - watched it fail

Per the issue's discipline point ("a test that cannot fail proves
nothing"), I temporarily hard-coded the count to 0 in `catalog.py`
(`optional_count = 0  # DELIBERATELY BROKEN ...`), reran
`test_catalog.py`, and confirmed **3 assertions in the new case went red**:

```
FAIL  one optional lesson emits optional_lesson_count: 1 (got None)
FAIL  three optional lessons emit optional_lesson_count: 3 (got '0')
FAIL  the literal three form appears in the written catalogue
```

(The zero-lesson assertion stayed green, correctly - 0 broken to 0 is not a
detectable difference, which is exactly why the case needed a one- and a
three-count bundle alongside the zero-count one.)

I then reverted the edit and diffed the file against a saved pristine copy
(`diff /tmp/c8pin/catalog.py.orig catalog.py`) to confirm the revert was
byte-exact, and reran the suite to confirm all 100 assertions passed again
before committing.

## The table, verified three independent ways against `../belay-bundles`

Ran `catalog.py <bundles-repo> -o -` (stdout only, nothing written) against
the real repository:

| bundle | optional_lesson_count |
|---|---|
| durable-event-broker | 3 |
| portable-bytebeat-wav | 1 |
| portable-fixed-window-rate-limiter | 1 |
| webgl-typescript-scene | 1 |
| rust-automaton-db | 0 |

This is **exactly** the table given on the issue. No discrepancy was found,
so nothing needed correcting.

Cross-checked two more ways, neither of which goes through `catalog.py`'s
own new code path, so the match isn't just catalog.py agreeing with itself:

1. Loaded each bundle's `tutorial.yaml` with `bundlelib.load_manifest` directly
   and read `optional_lessons` from the raw manifest dict (bypassing
   `Bundle.optional` and `catalog.py` entirely) - same five numbers, same
   lesson paths named.
2. Extracted each bundle's `optional_lessons:` block from the raw YAML text
   with `awk` (no YAML parser at all) and counted the top-level entries by
   eye - same five numbers.

## Files touched

- `skills/belay-authoring/scripts/catalog.py`
- `tests/test_catalog.py`
- `docs/superpowers/optional-lesson-count-report.md` (this report)

Nothing under `/Users/robert/src/github.com/skomp/belay` or
`../belay-bundles` was touched.
